<p> My name is Kory Friedman. I am 28 years old and love to live my life to fullest and costantly learn something new everyday. 
Life is a journey and we are all looking to live laugh and love often.</p>
<p>I love to go to the beach, go camping, music festivals and travling. 
My hobbies right now consist mainly of my dog and learning how to become a web developer. This is something that has always peaked my interested and trying to learn on my own was getting me nowhere.</p>
<p>I hope that when I am 75 years old I can look back all the amazing moments and events in my life and feel fullfiled.Life is but a dream and you are the dreamer. So lets make some magic and enjoy what we have. </p>
